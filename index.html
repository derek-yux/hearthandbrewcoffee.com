                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Nestled in the vibrant streets of Toronto, <b>Hearth & Brew</b> was born from a simple dream: to create a space that <b>feels like home</b>, no matter where you're from.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our café combines the <b>warmth</b> of a living room with the <b>aroma</b> of freshly brewed coffee. Every corner is designed with <b>comfort</b> in mind—from our plush armchairs to the crackling fireplace that warms our space during those long Canadian winters.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We source our beans from <b>ethical</b> farms around the world and roast them in-house to bring you the perfect cup every time. Our baked goods are made fresh daily, using recipes <b>passed down through generations</b>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Whether you're looking for a quiet corner to work, a cozy spot to read, or a friendly place to meet with friends, <b>Hearth & Brew is your home away from home</b>.</p>
